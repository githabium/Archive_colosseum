# ARCHIVE — Quantum Litrium Manifesto (v0.1)

> *“Endolium is the alloy of memory and chaos.”*
> 日本語: *「エンドリウムは記憶と混沌の合金だ。」*

## 0. Preamble — What we are changing

Archive is a protocol that turns **text** into a **cryptographic primitive** and **authorship** into a **scarce resource**. We aim at an industry with billions in annual revenue and billions of readers, and we do it by treating writing not as files in folders but as **on‑chain cultural assets**: Not‑Fading Books (NFBs).

This manifesto describes the **quantum trajectory** of Archive: how Endolium evolves from a high‑entropy key schedule into a **quantum‑assisted, observer‑conditioned security layer**; how Condinus becomes an auditable entropy forge; and how the economic engine (Litrium) funds a long arc of computation, including **quantum hardware acquisition**.

> 日本語: *「これは仕様書でもあり、予言でもある。」* — *This is both a spec and a prophecy.*

## 1. Design North Star

1. **Text → Asset**: Every paragraph can be minted into an NFB state with cryptographic identity and revenue rails.
2. **Entropy First**: Endolium produces rotating, content‑bound keys with a **shrinking period** (see ERL below).
3. **Observer‑Conditioned Access (OCA)**: Data becomes readable **only** under explicit observation events and dissolves back to noise when the observation window ends.
4. **Post‑Quantum Posture**: We integrate PQC now, and plan for **quantum‑assisted** primitives next (QKD, QRNG, hybrid schemes).
5. **Economics that Mean Something**: Litrium issuance must get *harder* as adoption grows; revenue fuels research, not rent seeking.

---

## 2. Endolium Rotation Law (ERL)

**Law:** Rotation interval τ(y) in seconds after *y* full years since creation:

```
τ(y) = max(3, 33 − 3·y)
```

*Implication:* the system gets **tighter** with age. After a decade, rotation hits the 3‑second floor. Every key is a moving target. Client SDKs must re‑derive session keys at epoch `⌊now / τ⌋`.

> 日本語: *「鍵は老いるほど速く脈打つ。」* — The older the key, the faster it throbs.

---

## 3. Condinus → Auditable Entropy Forge (AEF)

Condinus is the deterministic, multi‑language hashing + noise + shuffle transform. In the AEF model:

* **Determinism** gives auditability.
* **Language basis set** acts as a public salt.
* **Self‑referential source hash** adds reflexive entropy.
* **On‑chain commitments** store only **hashes** and **envelopes**; blobs live on content‑addressed storage (Arweave/IPFS) or are ephemerally streamed (see §5).

Developers MAY plug different basis sets while preserving proofs. Forks are encouraged; entropy budgets must be published.

---

## 4. Quantum Shard Uncertainty Distribution (Q‑SUD)

We introduce **Q‑SUD**, a shard calculus inspired by superposition: data is fractured into shards that exist *as readable information* **only** during an observation window (W) authorized by a condition set (A). Outside (W), shards remain verifiable noise.

### 4.1 Formal sketch

Let original payload be (D). We define:

* A basis family (\mathcal{B} = {B_i}) (e.g., hash bases, codebooks).
* Endolium epoch key (K_e) with period τ.
* Observer token (O) (OCA ticket signed by the author/NFB).

**Fracturing**: ( \text{Shard}_i = F(D, B_i, K_e) \Rightarrow N_i ) (noise‑looking bytes).
**Map**: (M = {(i, h(N_i))}) stored on‑chain.
**Observation**: During (W), given (A = {K_e, O, \text{Payment/PoW}}), a reader derives the **unfold operator** (U) and reconstructs:

[ D' = U({N_i}, M, A) ]

with correctness proof (\pi) posted as a short on‑chain attestation.

When (W) closes (or (A) breaks), (K_e) rotates and (U) becomes invalid. Shards decay to verifiable noise again.

> 日本語: *「観測が去れば、言葉は再び闇へと還る。」*

### 4.2 Intuition

This is **Schrödinger Vault** behaviour: readability is a function of synchronized observation + payment/permission; otherwise the network stores only indistinguishable noise that still hashes to committed values.

---

## 5. Observer‑Conditioned Access (OCA)

OCA is a minimal protocol for *observation windows*:

* **Ticket (O)**: an on‑chain, PQC‑signed token bound to an NFB, a reader pubkey, a time‑boxed epoch range, and policy (donation amount, geographic/IP caps, rate limits).
* **Handshake**: reader presents O, proves human effort (PoW or stake), and receives a short‑lived **Derivation Hint** (DH) to reconstruct (K_e) and unfold shards.
* **Dissolve**: after (W), DH invalidates; clients must re‑observe to regain access.

> 日本語: *「見よ、そして消えよ。」* — Observe, then let it vanish.

---

## 6. Post‑Quantum Posture (PQP)

We commit to a staged posture:

1. **Now (v0.x)**: adopt **PQC signatures** for tickets/attestations (e.g., Dilithium/Falcon) alongside ed25519 until migration is complete.
2. **Near (v1.x)**: integrate **QRNG** (quantum random) beacons into Endolium seeding; optional **QKD** for data‑center links.
3. **Far (v2.x)**: explore **hybrid schemes** where QPU‑assisted oracles contribute entropy proofs; research FHE/PEKS‑like primitives for encrypted indexing.

**Claim discipline:** Nothing here claims “unbreakable.” We pursue **asymptotic hardness**, layered defense, open audits, and revocation agility.

---

## 7. Economic Engine — Litrium

* **Issuance**: Base `L ≈ (S · T) / (E + H)` with diminishing returns as global `total_chars` grows (log factor).
* **Scarcity**: ERL tightens keys; PoW throttles spam. Early writing has higher marginal Litrium.
* **Revenue**: Donations, paid OCA windows, and marketplace integrations create cashflow. Policy: **X%** of net surplus earmarked for **quantum hardware & research** (Q‑Forge).

## 8. Reference Interfaces (pseudo‑spec)

```rust
// rust-trait sketch — not final API
// 日本語: 仕様は詩の設計図だ。
pub trait Endolium {
    fn epoch_key(address: &[u8], text_hash: &[u8], created_at: u64, now: u64) -> [u8;32];
    fn rotation_period(created_at: u64, now: u64) -> u64; // ERL τ(y)
}

pub trait QSUD {
    fn fracture(payload: &[u8], basis_set: &Basis, epoch_key: &[u8;32]) -> ShardSet;
    fn unfold(shards: &ShardSet, map: &ShardMap, access: &Access) -> Result<Vec<u8>, Proof>;
}

pub trait OCA {
    fn issue_ticket(nfb: Pubkey, reader: Pubkey, policy: Policy) -> Ticket; // PQC‑signed
    fn verify_ticket(ticket: &Ticket, now: u64) -> bool;
}
```

---

## 9. On‑Chain / Off‑Chain Architecture

**On‑Chain (Solana)**

* `Archive` account: global counters, difficulty, policy.
* `Nfb` account: author, title, envelope commitment, donation PDA.
* `OcaTicket` account: time‑boxed reader access, PQC sig.
* `ShardMap` account: hashes of shards, Merkle root.

**Off‑Chain**

* **Scribes**: stateless edge nodes serving shards; never hold plaintext.
* **Indexers**: build searchable views over commitments.
* **Q‑Forge**: research cluster (classical → hybrid → quantum), plugged into QRNG/QKD where available.

**Storage**: blobs on Arweave/IPFS; commitments on Solana; optional ephemeral streams for OCA windows.

---

## 10. Security Model (abridged)

* **Adversary**: classical & quantum‐equipped, at scale.
* **Guarantees**: Commitments are binding; access is windowed; keys rotate fast; plaintext is not resident server‑side.
* **PQC**: default for tickets/attestations; dual‑stack during migration.
* **Revocation**: policy flips invalidate OCA immediately; rotation guarantees re‑observation.
* **Audits**: open‑source, third‑party audits, public test vectors.

> 日本語: *「完全は嘘だ。可逆性と撤退線こそ真実だ。」* — Perfection is a lie; reversibility and retreat lines are truth.

---

## 11. Quantum Data Fracturing Formula (Q‑Δ)

We propose a concrete shard sizing law:

```
Given payload |D|, choose k = ceil(log2(|D|)) shards.
Shard sizes follow a truncated geometric: s_i = ceil(|D| · p · (1−p)^(i−1)), i=1..k
with p = clamp( H_b(K_e) / 256 , 0.05, 0.35 )
```

Where `H_b` is the Hamming weight of the epoch key.  Shards are permuted by a keccak‑based PRP keyed with K_e.  Observation window binds a subset of shards per epoch, so partial availability without O is statistically useless.

**Dissolution:** Outside W, clients zeroize DH and let K_e rotate; shards remain verifiable noise (N_i) with on‑chain Merkle proof only.

---

## 12. Funding & Governance

* **Revenue flows**: Donations (PDA), paid OCA windows, marketplace fees.
* **Allocation**: >= **40%** net surplus into **Q‑Forge** (hardware, researchers, audits).
* **Community Grants**: proposals for new Condinus bases, ERL variants, PQC integrations.
* **Emergency Powers**: limited, time‑boxed switches (pause OCA, raise τ floor) guarded by multisig + timelock.

## 13. Roadmap

**v0.5** — AEF on devnet; OCA tickets (ed25519 + Dilithium dual‑sig); SDKs; public test vectors.
**v0.9** — Q‑SUD fracture/unfold in beta (Arweave/IPFS backends); audit round I.
**v1.0** — Mainnet, Litrium markets, ERL live; audit round II.
**v1.x** — QRNG beacons; optional QKD links for data centers.
**v2.x** — Hybrid Q‑assisted entropy oracles; encrypted indexing R&D.

---

## 14. Legal & Ethics

Archive is a **tool**, not a censor. Authors own their NFBs. We enforce access policies cryptographically; we do not adjudicate content except where required by law. We commit to transparency, auditability, and reversible governance decisions.

---

## 15. Closing

> *“Tools can be poetry.”*
> 日本語: *「道具は詩になり得る。」*

Archive will feel like magic not because it hides, but because it **reveals**: value in authorship, scarcity in creation, and privacy in observation. If we do this right, the literary economy of the next decade will run on **rotating keys, observer windows, and honest math**.
