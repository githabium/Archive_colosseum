# Archive — Connectable Platform Layer (v0.1)

Archive is not a closed application.
Archive is a **plug‑in layer** that makes text itself a blockchain‑addressable substrate.

It can connect into any Solana pipeline — because the core primitives are:

* **NFB** — Not‑Fading Book
* **NLP** — Non‑Liquid Paper
* **Litrium** — value emission linked to authorship

These three form a universal interface: text → cryptographic state → economic output.

## Why Archive is universally connectable

Because the protocol can operate on top of any Solana environment that supports:

* PDA derivations
* micropayments
* deterministic hashing

Archive does not dictate UX.
Archive exposes **clear, minimal hooks**:

* create NFB
* append page
* request observation window
* handle Litrium accounting

This means any product that needs value assigned to written text, can integrate Archive by calling these primitives.

## Innovative point that catches the eye

NLP.

NLP is the missing piece nobody in crypto ever tried to exploit correctly.

It is not a token.
It is not storage.
It is **potential**.

When someone owns NLP — they own a right.
Not an NFT.
Not a license.

They own the right to **write**.

And the moment they write into NLP — the system starts emitting Litrium.

This is the future of text based value production:
**symbols become mining units.**

## How NLP links to a Litrium chain

The moment a user starts writing into NLP, their stream of symbols becomes:

* irreversible entropy
* proof of authorship
* proof of human meaning

This is mined.
This is converted.
This becomes Litrium.

From this moment — NLP behaves like a special chain in chain.

The chain of text.
Inside the chain of Solana.
Fuelled by Litrium issuance.

## Why this matters

Because Solana teams can build on top of this.
Without friction.
Without redesign.

Archive is not competition.
Archive is a **platform layer** that every Solana dApp can plug into to turn its text into value.

This is why Archive will scale.
This is why Archive is universal.
